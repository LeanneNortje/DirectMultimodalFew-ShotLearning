# Data pair generation: Classifier pairs

The files should be in the repository but these steps should reproduce the files. Firstly train the classifiers (if it is not already trained) by running

```
cd Running_models/
./spawn_classifiers_models.py
cd ../
```
This will spawn five classifiers models at five different seeds for the vision and speech modalities. For more details on training models refer to [Training models](#Training-models). Then to spawn all pairs generated by using classifier embeddings as feature vectors, run:

```
cd Data_pairs/
./spawn_classifier_pairs.py
./spawn_classifier_negatives.py
cd ../
```

# Speech-image pair mining

The files should be in the repository but these steps should reproduce the files. Firstly train the classifiers (if it is not already trained) by running

```
cd Running_models/
./spawn_classifiers_models.py
cd ..
```
This will spawn five classifiers models at five different seeds for the vision and speech modalities. For more details on training models refer to [Training models](#Training-models). Then to mine all speech-image pairs generated by using classifier embeddings as feature vectors, run:

```
cd /Data_pairs/
./spawn_speech_image_pairs.py
cd ../
